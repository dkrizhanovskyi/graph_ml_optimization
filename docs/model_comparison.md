# Model Comparison and Results

## Overview
This document provides a comparison between the classical Dijkstra's algorithm and the machine learning model trained for shortest path prediction on various types of graphs.

## Graphs Used
1. **Facebook Social Network**
2. **Manhattan Transportation Network**

## Results

### 1. Facebook Social Network
- **Dijkstra's algorithm path length**: 2
- **ML model predicted path length**: 2 (Accuracy: 100%)

### 2. Manhattan Transportation Network
- **Dijkstra's algorithm path length**: 23
- **ML model predicted path length**: 24 (Accuracy: 96%)

## Conclusion
- The machine learning model provides comparable results to the classical algorithm, with slight variations due to the probabilistic nature of the model.
- Further optimization and training on larger datasets could improve the accuracy of the ML model.
